In my previous article, I wrote that ``os.listdir(str)`` ignored silently
undecodable filenames in Python 3.0 and that lying on the real content of a
directory looks like a very bad idea.

**Martin v. Löwis** found a very smart solution to this problem: the
``surrogateescape`` error handler.

**This article is the second in a series of articles telling the history and
rationale of the Python 3 Unicode model for the operating system:**

* 1. `Python 3.0 listdir() Bug on Undecodable Filenames <{filename}/python30_listdir.rst>`_
* 2. `Python 3.1 surrogateescape error handler (PEP 383) <{filename}/pep383.rst>`_
* 3. `Python 3.2 Painful History of the Filesystem Encoding <{filename}/fs_encoding.rst>`_
* 4. `Python 3.6 now uses UTF-8 on Windows <{filename}/windows_utf8.rst>`_
* 5. `Python 3.7 New UTF-8 Mode <{filename}/utf8_mode.rst>`_

First attempt to propose the solution
=====================================

September 2008, `bpo-3187 <https://bugs.python.org/issue3187>`__: While
solutions to fix ``os.listdir(str)`` were discussed, **Martin v. Löwis**
`proposed a different approach <https://bugs.python.org/issue3187#msg73992>`_:

    I'd like to propose yet another approach: make sure that **conversion**
    according to the file system encoding **always succeeds**. **If an
    unconvertable byte is detected, map it into some private-use character.**
    To reduce the chance of conflict with other people's private-use
    characters, we can use some of the plane 15 private-use characters, e.g.
    map byte 0xPQ to U+F30PQ (in two-byte Unicode mode, this would result in
    a surrogate pair).

    This would make all file names accessible to all text processing
    (including glob and friends); UI display would typically either report
    an encoding error, or arrange for some replacement glyph to be shown.

    There are certain variations of the approach possible, in case there is
    objection to a specific detail.

He amended this proposal:

    **James Knight** points out that UTF-8b can be used to give unambiguous
    round-tripping of characters in a UTF-8 locale. So I would like to amend my
    previous proposal:

    - for a non-UTF-8 encoding, use private-use characters for roundtripping
    - if the locale's charset is UTF-8, use UTF-8b as the file system encoding.

**But Martin's smart idea was lost** in the middle of long discussion.

PEP 383
=======

April 2009, Martin v. Löwis proposed again his idea, now as the well defined
:pep:`383`: **Non-decodable Bytes in System Character Interfaces**. He `posted
his PEP to python-dev
<https://mail.python.org/pipermail/python-dev/2009-April/088919.html>`_ for
comments.

Abstract:

    File names, environment variables, and command line arguments are defined
    as being character data in POSIX; the C APIs however allow passing
    arbitrary bytes - whether these conform to a certain encoding or not.

    **This PEP proposes a means of dealing with such irregularities by embedding
    the bytes in character strings in such a way that allows recreation of the
    original byte string.**

The ``surrogateescape`` encoding is based on **Markus Kuhn**'s idea that he
called **UTF-8b**. Undecodable bytes in range ``0x80-0xff`` are mapped as
Unicode surrogate characters: range ``U+DC80`` - ``U+DCFF``.

Example::

    >>> b'nonascii\xff'.decode('ascii')
    UnicodeDecodeError: 'ascii' codec can't decode byte 0xff (...)
    >>> b'nonascii\xff'.decode('ascii', 'surrogateescape')
    'nonascii\udcff'
    >>> 'nonascii\udcff'.encode('ascii', 'surrogateescape')
    b'nonascii\xff'

Using the ``surrogateescape`` error handler, **decoding cannot fail**.  For
example, ``os.listdir(str)`` no longer ignores silently undecodable filenames,
since all filenames became decodable with any encoding. Moreover, encoding
filenames with ``surrogateescape`` returns the original bytes unchanged.

`The PEP was accepted
<https://mail.python.org/pipermail/python-dev/2009-April/089278.html>`_ by
**Guido van Rossum** in less than one week!


Implementation
==============

May 2009, Martin v. Löwis opened the `bpo-5915
<https://bugs.python.org/issue5915>`__ to get a review on his implementation.

Two days later, after **Benjamin Peterson** and **Antoine Pitrou** reviews,
Martin pushed the `commit 011e8420
<https://github.com/python/cpython/commit/011e8420339245f9b55d41082ec6036f2f83a182>`__:

    Issue #5915: Implement PEP 383, Non-decodable Bytes
    in System Character Interfaces.

Five days later, Martin renamed his "utf8b" error handler to its final name
**surrogateescape**, `commit 43c57785
<https://github.com/python/cpython/commit/43c57785d3319249c03c3fa46c9df42a8ccd3e52>`__:

    Rename utf8b error handler to surrogateescape.

**Python 3.1** will be the first release getting the ``surrogateescape`` error
handler.

Conclusion
==========

In Python 3.0, ``os.listdir(str)`` ignored silently undecodable filenames which
was not ideal.

**Martin v. Löwis** proposed to apply **Markus Kuhn**'s idea called **UTF-8b**
in Python as a new ``surrogateescape`` error handler.

Martin's PEP was approved in less than one week and implemented a few days
later.

Using the ``surrogateescape`` error handler, decoding cannot fail:
``os.listdir(str)`` no longer ignores silently undecodable filenames.
Moreover, encoding filenames with ``surrogateescape`` returns the original
bytes unchanged.

The ``surrogateescape`` error handler fixed a lot of old and very complex
Unicode issues on Unix. It is still widely used in Python 3.6 to **not annoy
users with Unicode errors**.
