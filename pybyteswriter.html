CPython. These APIs are design to optimize code producing strings when the
ouput size is not known in advance.</p>
<p>I created the _PyUnicodeWriter API to reply to complains that Python 3 was much
slower than Python 2, especially with the new Unicode implementation (PEP 393).</p>

<h2>_PyAccu API</h2>
<p>Issue #12778: In 2011, Antoine Pitrou found a performance issue in the JSON
serializer when serializing many small objects: it used way too much memory for
temporary objects compared to the final output string.</p>
<p>The JSON serializer used a list of strings and joined all strings at the end of
create a final output string. Pseudocode:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
def serialize():
    pieces = [serialize(item) for item in self]
    return ''.join(pieces)
</pre>
<p>Antoine introduced an accumulator compacting the temporary list of &quot;small&quot;
strings and put the result in a second list of &quot;large&quot; strings. At the end, the
list of &quot;large&quot; strings was also compacted to build the final output string.
Pseudo-code:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
def serialize():
    small = []
    large = []
    for item in self:
        small.append(serialize(item))
        if len(small) &gt; 10000:
            large.append(''.join(small))
            small.clear()
    if small
        large.append(''.join(small))
    return ''.join(large)
</pre>
<p>The threshold of 10,000  strings is justified by this comment:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
/* Each item in a list of unicode objects has an overhead (in 64-bit
 * builds) of:
 *   - 8 bytes for the list slot
 *   - 56 bytes for the header of the unicode object
 * that is, 64 bytes.  100000 such objects waste more than 6MB
 * compared to a single concatenated string.
 */
</pre>
<p>Issue #12911: Antoine Pitrou found a similar performance issue in repr(list),
and so proposed to convert its accumular code into a new private _PyAccu API.
He added the _PyAccu API to Python 2.7.5 and 3.2.3. Title of te repr(list)
change: &quot;Fix memory consumption when calculating the repr() of huge tuples or
lists&quot;.</p>

<h2>The _PyUnicodeWriter API</h2>
<div class="section" id="inefficient-implementation-of-the-pep-393">
<h3>Inefficient implementation of the PEP 393</h3>
<p>In 2010, Python 3.3 got a completly new Unicode implementation, the Python type
<tt class="docutils literal">str</tt>, with the PEP 393. The implementation of the PEP was the topic of a
Google Summer of Code 2011 with the student Torsten Becker menthored by Martin
v. Löwis (author of the PEP). The project was successful: the PEP 393 was
implemented, it worked!</p>
<p>The first implementation of the PEP 393 used a lot of 32-bit character buffers
(<tt class="docutils literal">Py_UCS4</tt>) which uses a lot of memory and requires expensive conversion to
8-bit (<tt class="docutils literal">Py_UCS1</tt>, ASCII and Latin1) or 16-bit (<tt class="docutils literal">Py_UCS2</tt>, BMP) characters.</p>
<p>The new internal structures for Unicode strings are now very complex and
require to be smart when building a new string to avoid memory copies. I
created the _PyUnicodeWriter API to try to reduce expensive memory copies, and
even completly avoid memory copies in best cases.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="design-of-the-pyunicodewriter-api">
<h3>Design of the _PyUnicodeWriter API</h3>
<p>According to benchmarks, creating a <tt class="docutils literal">Py_UCS1*</tt> buffer and then expand it
to <tt class="docutils literal">Py_UCS2*</tt> or <tt class="docutils literal">Py_UCS4*</tt> is more efficient, since <tt class="docutils literal">Py_UCS1*</tt> is the
most common format.</p>
<p>Python <tt class="docutils literal">str</tt> type is used for a wide range of usages. For example, it is used
for the name of variable names in the Python language itself. Variable names
are almost always ASCII.</p>
<p>The worst case for _PyUnicodeWriter is when a long <tt class="docutils literal">Py_UCS1*</tt> buffer must be
converted to <tt class="docutils literal">Py_UCS2*</tt>, and then converted to <tt class="docutils literal">Py_UCS4*</tt>. Each conversion
is expensive: need to allocate a second memory block and convert characters to
the new format.</p>
<p>_PyUnicodeWriter features:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Optional overallocation: overallocate the buffer by 50% on Windows and 25%
on Linux. The ratio changes depending on the OS, it is a raw heuristic to get
the best performances depending on the <tt class="docutils literal">malloc()</tt> memory allocator.</li>
<li>The buffer can be a shared read-only string if the buffer was only created
from a single string. Micro-optimization for <tt class="docutils literal">&quot;%s&quot; % str</tt>.</li>
</ul>
<p>The API allows to disable overallocation before the last write. For example,
<tt class="docutils literal">&quot;%s%s&quot; % ('abc', 'def')</tt> disables the overallocation before writing
<tt class="docutils literal">'def'</tt>.</p>
<p>The _PyUnicodeWriter was introduced by the issue #14716 (change 7be716a47e9d):</p>
<blockquote>
Close #14716: str.format() now uses the new &quot;unicode writer&quot; API instead
of the PyAccu API. For example, it makes str.format() from 25% to 30%
faster on Linux.</blockquote>
</div>
<div class="section" id="fast-path-for-ascii">
<h3>Fast-path for ASCII</h3>
<p>The cool and <em>unexpected</em> side-effect of the _PyUnicodeWriter is that many
intermediate operations got a fast-path for <tt class="docutils literal">Py_UCS1*</tt>, especially for ASCII
strings. For example, padding a number with spaces on <tt class="docutils literal">'%10i' % 123</tt> is
implemented with <tt class="docutils literal">memset()</tt>.</p>
<p>Formating a floating point number uses the <tt class="docutils literal">PyOS_double_to_string()</tt> function
which creates an ASCII buffer. If the writer buffer uses Py_UCS1, a
<tt class="docutils literal">memcpy()</tt> is enough to copy the formatted number.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="avoid-temporary-buffers">
<h3>Avoid temporary buffers</h3>
<p>Since the beginning, I had the idea of avoiding temporary buffers thanks
to an unified API to handle a &quot;Unicode buffer&quot;. Slowly, I spread my changes
to all functions producing Unicode strings.</p>
<p>The obvious target were <tt class="docutils literal">str % args</tt> and <tt class="docutils literal">str.format(args)</tt>. Both
instructions use very different code, but it was possible to share a few
functions especially the code to format integers in bases 2 (binary), 8
(octal), 10 (decimal) and 16 (hexadecimal).</p>
<p>The function formatting an integer computes the exact size of the output,
requests a number of characters and then write characters. The characters are
written directly in the writer buffer. No temporary memory block is needed
anymore, and moreover no Py_UCS conversion is need: <tt class="docutils literal">_PyLong_Format()</tt> writes
directly characters into the character format (PyUCS1, Py_UCS2 or Py_UCS4) of
the buffer.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="performance-compared-to-python-2">
<h3>Performance compared to Python 2</h3>
<p>The PEP 393 uses a complex storage for strings, so the exact performances
now depends on the character set used in the benchmark. For benchmarks using
a character set different than ASCII, the result are more tricky to understand.</p>
<p>To compare performances with Python 2, I focused my benchmarks on ASCII.  I
compared Python 3 str with Python 2 unicode, but also sometimes to Python 2 str
(bytes). On ASCII, Python 3.3 was as fast as Python 2, or even faster on some
very specific cases, but these cases are probably artificial and never seen in
real applications.</p>
<p>In the best case, Python 3 str (Unicode) was faster than Python 2 bytes.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="section" id="pybyteswriter-api-first-try-big-fail">
<h2>_PyBytesWriter API: first try, big fail</h2>
<p>Since Python was <em>much</em> faster with _PyUnicodeWriter, I expected to get good
speedup with a similar API for bytes. The graal would be to share code for
bytes and Unicode (Spoiler alert! I reached this goal, but only for a single
function: format an integer to decimal).</p>
<p>My first attempt of a _PyBytesWriter API was in 2013: <a class="reference external" href="https://bugs.python.org/issue17742">Issue #17742: Add
_PyBytesWriter API</a>. But quickly, I
noticed with microbenchmarks that my change made Python slower! I spent hours
to understand why GCC produced less efficient machine code. When I started to
dig the &quot;strict aliasing&quot; optimization issue, I realized that I reached a
deadend.</p>
<p>Extract of the _PyBytesWriter structure:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
typedef struct {
    /* Current position in the buffer */
    char *str;

    /* Start of the buffer */
    char *start;

    /* End of the buffer */
    char *end;

    ...
} _PyBytesWriter;
</pre>
<p>The problem is that GCC emited less efficient machine code for the C code (see
my <a class="reference external" href="https://bugs.python.org/issue17742#msg187595">msg187595</a>):</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
while (collstart++&lt;collend)
    *writer.str++ = '?';
</pre>
<p>For the <tt class="docutils literal">writer.str++</tt> instruction, the new pointer value is written
immediatly in the structure. The pointer value is read again at each iteration.
So we have 1 LOAD and 1 STORE per iteration.</p>
<p>GCC emits better code for the original C code:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
while (collstart++&lt;collend)
    *str++ = '?';
</pre>
<p>The <tt class="docutils literal">str</tt> variable is stored in a register and the new value of <tt class="docutils literal">str</tt> is
only written <em>once</em>, at the end of loop (instead of writing it at each
iteration). The pointer value is <em>only read once</em> before the loop. So we have 0
LOAD and 0 STORE (related to the pointer value) in the loop body.</p>
<p>It looks like an aliasing issue, but I didn't find how to say to GCC that the
new value of <tt class="docutils literal">writer.str</tt> can be written only once at the end of the loop. I
tried the <tt class="docutils literal">__restrict__</tt> keyword: the LOAD (get the pointer value) was moved
out of the loop. But the STORE was still in the loop body.</p>
<p>I wrote to gcc-help: <a class="reference external" href="https://gcc.gnu.org/ml/gcc-help/2013-04/msg00192.html">Missed optimization when using a structure</a>, but I didn't get any
reply. I just gave up.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="pybyteswriter-api-new-try-the-good-one">
<h2>_PyBytesWriter API: new try, the good one</h2>
<p>In 2015, I created the <a class="reference external" href="https://bugs.python.org/issue25318">Issue #25318: Add _PyBytesWriter API to optimize
Unicode encoders</a>. I redesigned the API
to avoid the aliasing issue.</p>
<p>The new _PyBytesWriter doesn't contain the <tt class="docutils literal">char*</tt> pointers anymore: they are
now local variables in functions. Instead, functions of API requires two
parameters: the bytes writer and a <tt class="docutils literal">char*</tt> parameter. Example:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
PyObject * _PyBytesWriter_Finish(_PyBytesWriter *writer, char *str)
</pre>
<p>The idea is to keep <tt class="docutils literal">char*</tt> pointers in functions to keep the most efficient
machine code in loops. The compiler doesn't have to compute complex aliasing
rules to decide if a CPU register can be used or not.</p>
<p>_PyBytesWriter features:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Optional overallocation: overallocate the buffer by 25% on Windows and 50%
on Linux. Same idea than _PyUnicodeWriter.</li>
<li>Support <tt class="docutils literal">bytes</tt> and <tt class="docutils literal">bytearray</tt> type as output format to avoid an expensive
memory copy from <tt class="docutils literal">bytes</tt> to <tt class="docutils literal">bytearray</tt>.</li>
<li>Small buffer of 512 bytes allocated on the stack to avoid the need of a
buffer allocated on the heap, before creating the final
<tt class="docutils literal">bytes</tt>/<tt class="docutils literal">bytearray</tt> object.</li>
</ul>
<p>A _PyBytesWriter structure must always be allocated on the stack (to get fast
memory allocation of the smaller buffer).</p>
<p>While _PyUnicodeWriter has a 5 functions and 1 macro to write a single
character, write strings, write a substring, etc. _PyBytesWriter has a single
_PyBytesWriter_WriteBytes() function to write a string, since all other writes
are done directly with regular C code on <tt class="docutils literal">char*</tt> pointers.</p>
<p>The API itself doesn't make the code faster. Disabling overallocation on the
last write and the usage of the small buffer allocated on the stack may be
faster.</p>
<p>In Python 3.6, I optimized error handlers on various codecs: ASCII, Latin1
and UTF-8. For example, the UTF-8 encoder is now up to 75 times as fast for
error handlers: <tt class="docutils literal">ignore</tt>, <tt class="docutils literal">replace</tt>, <tt class="docutils literal">surrogateescape</tt>,
<tt class="docutils literal">surrogatepass</tt>. The <tt class="docutils literal">bytes % int</tt> instruction became between 30% and 50%
faster on a microbenchmark.</p>
<p>Later, I replaced <tt class="docutils literal">char*</tt> type with <tt class="docutils literal">void*</tt> to avoid compiler warnings
in functions using <tt class="docutils literal">Py_UCS1*</tt> or <tt class="docutils literal">unsigned char*</tt>, unsigned types.</p>
