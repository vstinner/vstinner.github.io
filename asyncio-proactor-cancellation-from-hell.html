<p>Between 2014 and 2015, I was working on the new shiny <tt class="docutils literal">asyncio</tt> module
(module added to Python 3.4 released in March 2014). I helped to stabilize the
Windows implementation because... well, nobody else was paying attention to it,
and I was worried that test_asyncio <strong>randomly crashed</strong> on Windows.</p>
<p>One bug really annoyed me, I started to fix it in July 2014, but I only
succeeded to <strong>fix the root issue</strong> in January 2015: <strong>six months later</strong>!</p>
<p>It was really difficult to find documentation on IOCP and asynchronous
programming on Windows. <strong>I had to ask for help to someone who had access to
the Windows source code</strong> to understand the bug...</p>
<p><strong>Spoiler:</strong> cancelling an overlapped <tt class="docutils literal">RegisterWaitForSingleObject()</tt> with
<tt class="docutils literal">UnregisterWait()</tt> is asynchronous. The asynchronous part is not well
documented and it took me months of debug to understand it. Moreover, the bug
was well hidden for various reasons that we will see below.</p>

    ProactorIocp._register() now registers the overlapped
    in the _cache dictionary, even if we already got the result. We need to keep a
    reference to the overlapped object, otherwise the memory may be reused and
    GetQueuedCompletionStatus() may use random bytes and behaves badly.

    There is still a hack for ConnectNamedPipe(): the overlapped object is not
    registered into _cache if the overlapped object completed directly.

    Log also an error in debug mode in ProactorIocp._loop() if we get an unexpected
    event.

    Add a protection in ProactorIocp.close() to avoid blocking, even if it should
    not happen. I still don't understand exactly why some the completion of some
    overlapped objects are not notified.

<p>The change adds a long comment:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
# Even if GetOverlappedResult() was called, we have to wait for the

# Register the overlapped operation to keep a reference to the

#
# For an unknown reason, ConnectNamedPipe() behaves differently:
# the completion is not notified by GetOverlappedResult() if we

<h2>bpo-23095: race condition when cancelling a _WaitHandleFuture</h2>
<p>At December 21, 2014, five months after a long serie of changes to stabilize
asyncio...  <strong>asyncio was still crashing randomly on Windows</strong>! I created
<a class="reference external" href="https://bugs.python.org/issue23095">bpo-23095: race condition when cancelling a _WaitHandleFuture</a>.</p>
<p>On Windows using the IOCP (proactor) event loop, I noticed race conditions when
running the test suite of Trollius (my old deprecated asyncio port to Python
2). For example, sometimes the return code of a process was <tt class="docutils literal">None</tt>, whereas
this case <strong>must never happen</strong>. It looks like the <tt class="docutils literal">wait_for_handle()</tt> method
doesn't behave properly.</p>
<p>When I run the test suite of asyncio in debug mode (PYTHONASYNCIODEBUG=1),
sometimes I see the message &quot;GetQueuedCompletionStatus() returned an unexpected
event&quot; which <strong>should never occur neither</strong>.</p>
<p>I added debug traces. I saw that the <tt class="docutils literal">IocpProactor.wait_for_handle()</tt> calls
later <tt class="docutils literal">PostQueuedCompletionStatus()</tt> through its internal C callback
(<tt class="docutils literal">PostToQueueCallback</tt>). It looks like <strong>sometimes the callback is called
whereas the wait was cancelled/acked</strong> by <tt class="docutils literal">UnregisterWait()</tt>.</p>
<p>... I didn't understand the logic between <tt class="docutils literal">RegisterWaitForSingleObject()</tt>,
<tt class="docutils literal">UnregisterWait()</tt> and the callback ....</p>
<p>It looks like sometimes the overlapped object created in Python
(<tt class="docutils literal">ov = _overlapped.Overlapped(NULL)</tt>) is destroyed, before
<tt class="docutils literal">PostToQueueCallback()</tt> is called. In the unit tests, <strong>it doesn't crash
because a different overlapped object is created and it gets the same memory
address</strong> (the memory allocator reuses a just freed memory block).</p>
<p>The implementation of <tt class="docutils literal">wait_for_handle()</tt> had an optimization: it polls
immediatly the wait to check if it already completed. I tried to remove it, but
I got some different issues. If I understood correctly, <strong>this optimization
hides other bugs and reduce the probability of getting the race condition</strong>.</p>
<p><tt class="docutils literal">wait_for_handle()</tt> is used to wait for the completion of a subprocess, so by
all unit tests running subprocesses, but also in <tt class="docutils literal">test_wait_for_handle()</tt> and
<tt class="docutils literal">test_wait_for_handle_cancel()</tt> tests. I suspect that running
<tt class="docutils literal">test_wait_for_handle()</tt> or <tt class="docutils literal">test_wait_for_handle_cancel()</tt> triggers the
bug.</p>
<p>Removing <tt class="docutils literal">_winapi.CloseHandle(self._iocp)</tt> in <tt class="docutils literal">IocpProactor.close()</tt>
works around the bug. The bug looks to be an expected call to
<tt class="docutils literal">PostToQueueCallback()</tt> which calls <tt class="docutils literal">PostQueuedCompletionStatus()</tt> on an
IOCP. Not closing the IOCP means using a different IOCP for each test, so the
unexpected call to <tt class="docutils literal">PostQueuedCompletionStatus()</tt> has no effect on following
tests.</p>
<p>I rewrote some parts of the IOCP code in asyncio. Maybe I introduced this issue
during the refactoring. Maybe <strong>it already existed before but nobody noticed
it, asyncio had fewer unit tests before</strong>.</p>

    Issue #23095, asyncio: Rewrite _WaitHandleFuture.cancel()
</pre>
<p>This change fixes a race conditon related to <tt class="docutils literal">_WaitHandleFuture.cancel()</tt>
leading to a Python crash or &quot;GetQueuedCompletionStatus() returned an
unexpected event&quot; logs. Previously, <strong>it was possible that the cancelled wait
completes whereas the overlapped object was already destroyed</strong>. Sometimes, a
different overlapped was allocated at the same address, emitting a log about
unexpected completition (but no crash).</p>
<p><tt class="docutils literal">_WaitHandleFuture.cancel()</tt> now <strong>waits until the handle wait is cancelled</strong>
(until the cancellation completes) before clearing its reference to the
overlapped object. To wait until the cancellation completes,
<tt class="docutils literal">UnregisterWaitEx()</tt> is used with an event (instead of using
<tt class="docutils literal">UnregisterWait()</tt>).</p>
<p>To wait for this event, a new <tt class="docutils literal">_WaitCancelFuture</tt> class was added. It's a
simplified version of <tt class="docutils literal">_WaitCancelFuture</tt>. For example, its <tt class="docutils literal">cancel()</tt>
method calls <tt class="docutils literal">UnregisterWait()</tt>, not <tt class="docutils literal">UnregisterWaitEx()</tt>.
<tt class="docutils literal">_WaitCancelFuture</tt> should not be cancelled.</p>
<p>The overlapped object is <strong>kept alive</strong> in <tt class="docutils literal">_WaitHandleFuture</tt> <strong>until the
wait is unregistered</strong>.</p>
<p>Later, I pushed a few more changes to fix corner cases.</p>

    Issue #23095, asyncio: Fix _WaitHandleFuture.cancel()

    If UnregisterWaitEx() fais with ERROR_IO_PENDING, it doesn't mean that the wait
    is unregistered yet. We still have to wait until the wait is cancelled.
</pre>
<p>I think that <em>this</em> issue can now be closed: <tt class="docutils literal">UnregisterWaitEx()</tt> really do
what we need in asyncio.</p>
<p>I don't like the complexity of the IocpProactor._unregister() method and of the
_WaitCancelFuture class, but it looks that it's how we are supposed to wait
until a wait for a handle is cancelled...</p>
<p>Windows IOCP API is much more complex that what I expected. It's probably
because some parts (especially <tt class="docutils literal">RegisterWaitForSingleObject()</tt>) are
implemented with threads in user land, not in the kernel.</p>
<p>In short, I'm very happy that have fixed this very complex but also very
annoying IOCP bug in asyncio.</p>
<p>I got a nice comment from <a class="reference external" href="https://bugs.python.org/issue23095#msg234453">Guido van Rossum</a>:</p>

<h2>Summary of the race condition</h2>
<p>Events of the crashing unit test:</p>
<ul class="simple">

<li>The wait future is cancelled (call <tt class="docutils literal">UnregisterWait()</tt>).</li>

memory of the previous overlapped. In this case, when the first overlapped
completes, Python didn't crash but logged an unexpected completion message.</p>
<p>Sometimes, the write was done in freed memory: the write didn't crash Python,
but caused bugs which didn't make sense.</p>
<p>There were even more cases causing even more surprising behaviors.</p>
<p>Summary of the fix:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>(... similar steps for the beginning ...)</li>
<li>The wait future is cancelled: <strong>create an event</strong> to wait until the
cancellation completes (call <tt class="docutils literal">UnregisterWaitEx()</tt>).</li>
<li>Wait for the event.</li>
<li>The event is signalled which means that the cancellation completed: <strong>write</strong>
into the overlapped memory.</li>
<li>The overlapped is destroyed: <strong>free</strong> overlapped memory.</li>
</ul>
