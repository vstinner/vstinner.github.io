	<div itemprop="articleBody" class="article-body"><p>My first article <a class="reference external" href="https://vstinner.github.io/intel-cpus.html">Intel CPUs</a> is a general
introduction on modern CPU technologies having an impact on benchmarks.</p>
<p>This second article is much more concrete with numbers and a concrete bug
having a major impact on benchmarks: a benchmark suddenly becomes 2x faster!</p>
<p>I will tell you how I first noticed the bug, which tests I ran to analyze the
issue, how I found commands to reproduce the bug, and finally how I identified
the bug.</p>
<div class="section" id="glitch-in-benchmarks">
<h2>&quot;Glitch&quot; in benchmarks</h2>
<p>Last week I ran a benchmark to check if enabling Profile Guided Optimization
(PGO) when compiling Python makes benchmark results less stable. I recompiled
Python 5 times, and after each compilation I ran a benchmark. I tested
different commands and options to compile Python. Everything was fine until
the last benchmark of the last compilation. <strong>The benchmark suddenly became 2
times faster.</strong></p>
<p>Hopefully, my perf module collects a lot of metadata. I was able to analyze
in depth what happened.</p>
<p>The &quot;glitch&quot; occurred in a benchmark having 400 runs (benchmark run in 400
different processes), between the run 105 (20.3 ms) and the run 106
(11.0 ms).</p>
<p>I noticed that the CPU temperature was between 69°C and 72°C until the run 105,
and then decreased to from 69°C to 58°C.</p>
<p>The system load slowly increased from 1.25 up to 1.62 around the run 108 and
then slowly decreased to 1.00.</p>
<p>The system was not idle while the benchmark was running. I was working on the
PC too! But according to timestamps, it seems like the glitch was close to when
I stopped working. When I stopped working, I closed all applications (except of
the benchmark running in background) and turned of my two monitors.</p>
<p>Well, at this point, it's hard to correlate for sure an event with the major
performance change.</p>
<p>So I started to analyze different factors affecting CPUs and benchmarks: Turbo
Boost, CPU temperature and CPU frequency.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="impact-of-turbo-boost-on-benchmarks">
<h2>Impact of Turbo Boost on benchmarks</h2>
<p>Without Turbo Boost, the maximum frequency of the &quot;Intel(R) Core(TM) i7-3520M
CPU &#64; 2.90GHz&quot; of my laptop is 2.9 GHz. With Turbo Boost, the maximum
frequency is 3.6 GHz if only one core is active, or 3.4 GHz otherwise:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
$ sudo cpupower frequency-info
  ...
  boost state support:
    Supported: yes
    Active: yes
    3400 MHz max turbo 4 active cores
    3400 MHz max turbo 3 active cores
    3400 MHz max turbo 2 active cores
    3600 MHz max turbo 1 active cores
</pre>
<p>I ran the bm_call_simple.py microbenchmark (CPU-bound) of performance 0.2.2.</p>
<p>Turbo Boost disabled:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>1 physical CPU active: 2.9 GHz, Median +- std dev: 14.6 ms +- 0.3 ms</li>
<li>2 physical CPU active: 2.9 GHz, Median +- std dev: 14.7 ms +- 0.5 ms</li>
</ul>
<p>Turbo Boost enabled:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>1 physical CPU active: 3.6 GHz, Median +- std dev: 11.8 ms +- 0.3 ms</li>
<li>2 physical CPU active: 3.4 GHz, Median +- std dev: 12.4 ms +- 0.1 ms</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>The maximum performance boost is 19% faster</strong> (14.6 ms =&gt; 11.8 ms), the
minimum boost if 15% faster (14.6 ms =&gt; 12.4 ms).</p>
<p>Hum, I don't think that Turbo Boost can explain the bug.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="impact-of-the-cpu-temperature-on-benchmarks">
<h2>Impact of the CPU temperature on benchmarks</h2>
<p>The CPU temperature is mentionned in Intel Turbo Boost documentation as a
factor used to decide which P-state will be used. I always wanted to check how
the CPU temperature impacts its performance.</p>
<div class="section" id="burn-the-cpu-of-my-desktop-pc">
<h3>Burn the CPU of my desktop PC</h3>
<p>CPU of my desktop PC: &quot;Intel(R) Core(TM) i7-2600 CPU &#64; 3.40GHz&quot;.</p>
<p>I used my <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/vstinner/misc/blob/master/bin/system_load.py">system_load.py script</a> to generate a
system load higher than 10.</p>
<p>When the fan is cooling correctly the CPU, all CPU run at 3.4 GHz (Turbo Boost
was disabled) and the CPU temperature is 66°C.</p>
<p>I used a simple sheet of paper to block the fan of my CPU. Yeah, I really
wanted to <a class="reference external" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xf0VuRG7MN4">burn my CPU</a>! More
seriously, I checked the CPU temperature every second using the <tt class="docutils literal">sensors</tt>
command and was prepared to unblock the fan if sometimes gone wrong.</p>
<img alt="Sheet of paper blocking the CPU fan" src="https://vstinner.github.io/images/paper_blocks_cpu_fan.jpg" />
<p>After one minute, the CPU reached 97°C. I expected a system crash, smoke or
something worse, but I was disappointed. <strong>At 97°C, I was still able to use my
computer as everything was fine. The CPU was slowly down automatically to the
minimum CPU frequency: 1533 MHz</strong> according to turbostat (the minimum frequency
of this CPU is 1.6 GHz).</p>
<p>When I unblocked the fan, the temperature decreased quickly to go back to its
previous state (62°C) and the CPU frequency quickly increased to 3.4 GHz as
well.</p>
<p>My Intel CPU is really impressive! I didn't expect such very efficient
protection against overheating!</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="burn-my-laptop-cpu">
<h3>Burn my laptop CPU</h3>
<p>I used my system_load.py script to get a system load over 200. I also opened 4
tabs in Firefox playing Youtube videos to stress also the GPU which is
integrated into the CPU (IGP) on such laptop.</p>
<img alt="Stress test playing Youtube videos in Firefox, CPU at 102°" src="https://vstinner.github.io/images/burn_cpu_firefox.jpg" />
<p>With such crazy stress test, the CPU temperature was &quot;only&quot; 83°C.</p>
<p>Using a simple tissue, I closed the air hole used by the CPU fan. <strong>When the
CPU temperature increased from 100°C to 101°C, the CPU frequency started slowly
to decrease from 3391 MHz to 3077 MHz</strong> (with steps between 10 MHz and 50 MHz
every second, or something like that).</p>
<p>When pushing hard the tissue and waiting longer than 5 minutes, the CPU
temperature increased up to 102°C, but the CPU frequency was only decreased
from 3.4 GHz (Turbo Mode with 4 active logical CPUs) to 3.1 GHz.</p>
<p>The maximum frequency is 2.9 GHz. Frequencies higher than 2.9 GHz means that
the Turbo Mode was enabled! It means that <strong>even with overheating, the CPU is
still fine and able to &quot;overclock&quot; itself!</strong></p>
<p>Again, I was disapointed. With a CPU at 102°C, my laptop was still super fast
and reactive.  It seems like mobile CPUs handle even better overheating than
desktop CPUs (which is not something suprising at all).</p>
</div>

<div class="section" id="impact-of-the-cpu-frequency-on-benchmarks">
<h2>Impact of the CPU frequency on benchmarks</h2>
<p>I ran the bm_call_simple.py microbenchmark (CPU-bound) of performance 0.2.2
on my desktop PC.</p>
<p>Command to set the frequency of CPU 0 to the minimum frequency (1.6 GHz):</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
$ cat /sys/devices/system/cpu/cpu0/cpufreq/cpuinfo_min_freq|sudo tee  /sys/devices/system/cpu/cpu0/cpufreq/scaling_max_freq
1600000
</pre>
<p>Command to set the frequency of CPU 0 to the maximum frequency (3.4 GHz):</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
$ cat /sys/devices/system/cpu/cpu0/cpufreq/cpuinfo_max_freq|sudo tee  /sys/devices/system/cpu/cpu0/cpufreq/scaling_max_freq
3400000
</pre>
<ul class="simple">
<li>CPU running at 1.6 GHz (min freq): Median +- std dev: 27.7 ms +- 0.7 ms</li>
<li>CPU running at 3.4 GHz (min freq): Median +- std dev: 12.9 ms +- 0.2 ms</li>
</ul>
<p>The impact of the CPU frequency is quite obvious: <strong>when the CPU frequency is
doubled, the performance is also doubled</strong>. The benchmark is 53% faster (27.7
ms =&gt; 12.9 ms).</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="bug-reproduced-and-then-identified-in-the-linux-cpu-driver">
<h2>Bug reproduced and then identified in the Linux CPU driver</h2>
<p>Two days ago, I ran a very simple &quot;timeit&quot; microbenchmark to try to bisect a
performance regression in Python 3.6 on <tt class="docutils literal">functools.partial</tt>. Again, suddenly,
the microbenchmark became 2x faster!</p>
<p>But this time, I found something: I noticed that running or stopping <tt class="docutils literal">cpupower
monitor</tt> and/or <tt class="docutils literal">turbostat</tt> can &quot;enable&quot; or &quot;disable&quot; the bug.</p>
<p>After a lot of tests, I understood that running the benchmark with turbostat
&quot;disables&quot; the bug, whereas running &quot;cpupower monitor&quot; while running a
benchmark enables the bug.</p>
<p>I reported the bug in the Fedora bug tracker, on the component kernel:
<a class="reference external" href="https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1378529">intel_pstate C0 bug on isolated CPUs with the performance governor and
NOHZ_FULL</a>.</p>
<p>It seems like the bug is related to CPU isolation and NOHZ_FULL. The NOHZ_FULL
option is able to fully disable the scheduler clock interruption  on isolated
CPUs. I understood the the <tt class="docutils literal">intel_pstate</tt> driver uses a callback on the
scheduler to update the Pstate of the CPU. According to an Intel engineer, the
<tt class="docutils literal">intel_pstate</tt> driver was never tested with CPU isolation.</p>
<p>The issue is not fully analyzed yet, but at least I succeeded to write a list
of commands to reproduce it with a success rate of 100% :-) Moreover, the Intel
engineer suggested to add an extra parameter to the Linux kernel command
(<tt class="docutils literal">rcu_nocbs=3,7</tt>) line which works around the issue.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="conclusion">
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>This article describes how I found and then identified a bug in the Linux
driver of my CPU.</p>
<p>Summary:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>The maximum speedup of Turbo Boost is 20%</li>
<li>Overheating on a dekstop PC can decrease the CPU frequency to its minimum
(half of the maximum in my case) which imply a slowdown of 50%</li>
<li>A bug in the Linux CPU driver changes suddenly the CPU frequency from its
minimum to maximum (or the opposite) which means a speedup of 50%
(or slowdown of 50%)</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>To get stable benchmarks, the safest fix for all these issues is probably to
set the CPU frequency of the CPUs used by benchmarks to the minimum.</strong>
It seems like nothing can reduce the frequency of a CPU below its minimum.</p>
<p><strong>When running benchmarks, raw timings and CPU performance don't matter. Only
comparisons between benchmark results and stable performances matter.</strong></p>
